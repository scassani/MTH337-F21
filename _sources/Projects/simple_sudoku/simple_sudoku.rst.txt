Simple Sudoku
==================

.. rubric:: (due: Sunday, Dec 12, 11:59 PM)


A **susoku** is a puzzle consisting of a 9x9 grid of numbers `Sudoku Wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku>`__.

The objective of the puzzle is to fill in the missing cells with numbers from 1-9 such that:

- Each row contains no repeated numbers
- Each column contains no repeated numbers
- Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (called also boxes) contains no repeated numbers  

We will be working with sudokus of the **Easy** cathegory (that requires **no recursion**)

Project
-------

Write a function that solve a **simple sodoku**. Some examples of the starting grid of a simple sudoku, that you are trying to solve for this project, are given in this file: :download:`sudokus.txt <sudokus.txt>`


The following function can be use to print the sudoku

.. code:: python

	def print_sudoku(arr): # arr is a 9x9 numpy array
	    for i in range(9):
        	for j in range(9):
	            x = arr[i, j] if arr[i, j] != 0 else "."
	            print(f" {x} ", end="")
	            if j in [2, 5]:
	                print("\u2551", end="")
	        print("")
	        if i in [2, 5]:
	            print("\u2550"*9 + "\u256C" + "\u2550"*9 + "\u256C" + "\u2550"*9)



**Note.**  This is a programming project. Your project report does not need
include narrative, beyond comments explaining how your code works. The project will
be graded according to the following rubrics:

* Code that successfully solves the simple sodoku: 70%
* Report organization and code documentation: 30%
