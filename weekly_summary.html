<li><p>How can you get all the first indexes of list elements?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[k[0] for k in mylist]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we have a quiz next week or are we done?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no quiz</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When is the due date for Project 8 going to be?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Sunday 12/12</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>using recursion, can you call the function more than once?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the function itself? Yes you can.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain how recursion functions in python work or give a resource that explains them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think google shoud be helpful enough. The main idea is that the structure of the code has some repetitive algorithm, so for example you can use recursion instead of a loop</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will recursion need be used in the sudoku project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no, it is not necessary</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is recursion necessary to solve Sudokus of higher difficulty? I know you said in class that the more simple way has a limit, but could we modify it without recursion to handle more difficult problems?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Technically yes, but for very hard sudokus recursion is the easiest solution.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes ‘Autosave’ does not work and it does not work even if I do manually. It shows there’s an error message. Do you know how to get rid of that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When that happens ususally it means the kernel got somewhat corrupted. What I usually do is select all cells and copy them in a fresh notebook to avoid losing material</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we use the recursive function, should we define it outside of our main function, or it’s ok to define in it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The recursion is ususally inside of the function</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can I enlarge the plot’s title and the data points in the plot? I’m using pie graph to show the percentage of the first 20 words which have the most word frequency, but the percentage of each part are too small to see, it is not ‘can’t observe’, it’s I need to zoom in to see the actual data, which is really inconvenient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fontsize</span></code> should work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m still unsure about when I need to apply recursion. Do you have any examples of when it would be needed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A very hard sudoku might need recursion.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Was this project language dependent? Can we reach the same conclusions to our analysis had we used a language other than English, assuming we are fluent in such said language?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I have never tryed a different language.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will be any curve for the class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What specifically can you use <cite>re.findall</cite> with?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>with specific patterns you want to look for</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How is it possible to use a function while defining the function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>that is the recursion advantage.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Have we reached the goal for the surveys yet? :D</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we graph all of the words into one graph?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes, but you have to be careful to avoid the graph being very hard to read</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do we use sets and is the process of appending very similar or does python treat it differently.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you can add to a set using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set1.add(element)</span></code></p>

<h2>Week 12<a class="headerlink" href="#week-12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If I want to define a function that cleans the start and end of a book, is there a point that I could use as a universal start point for each book? If I use book.find(”<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">*</span></a>START OF…”), as the starting character, my book will then include that statement. Is there something I could do so that it won’t include that, or does it not matter in essence since it is just a few extra words?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You could refine it using a diffent libray we haven’t seen yet (regular expressions) or you could use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">find</span></code> to get to the second <cite>***`</cite> which should be the begining of the actual book.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you correctly use lambda in order to make a key?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example: <cite>lambda x: x[1]</cite> would create a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lambda</span></code> function that retunrs the second element of a list. You can find more information and exmaples <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/python-lambda/">here</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project will it be a good idea to look at more then one bookes from the same auther and see if most frequent word match.  Alos could you go over how to make 3d graph using python. Can you show as in class how to do a 3d graph?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That could be a good idea. <a class="reference external" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.12-three-dimensional-plotting.html">here</a> you can find some info on 3d plotting.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you always need to make a function for the key argument in the sorted() function or are there also ‘pre-made’ keys?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span></code> should be a function. There are pre-made functions that you can use (say you wamt ot sort with resect to the average, you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.mean</span></code> as you key.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to sort a dictionary without turning it into a list of the key-value pairs first?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No, since dictionaries are not ordered.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can request be used to get a python file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>sure</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tuesday if we have questions on the project, can we ask them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>sure</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>still have no idea on the least project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>this is not a question. You summary will not be counted for this week.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>in the current project we select only one book from the website to analyze, but what if I would like to go over 100 books from the website? Is there a way to automatically get the resources from a series of website with similar links?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a list of links, you could automatically request a bunch of those with a for loop</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any other functional behaviors we can find using python besides log and ln?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There might be. For example you might try to check for periodic function, testisng for repetition.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is creating the dictionary through collection faster then looping through the text?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it might be equivalent in terms of speed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can dictionaries hold pairs within the defined values?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you can use lists or tuples as values.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you turn a list into a dictionary?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends what are the elements of the list. If it is a list of pairs, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict(mylist)</span></code> will change it in a dictionary</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the result of <cite>collections.Counter(mylist)</cite> a dictionary?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>it is a collection object. You shoudl be able to change it into a dictionary using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dict</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would using logarithm be the most effective method of “Linearizing” a graph.  Let’s say instead we have a function, y = x^2. we could rewrite the equation as sqrt(y) = x and instead we graph x against sqrt(y). Would that work as well?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It shoudl work. The log approach is useful when you do not know the actual functional form.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many graphs should we have for the analysis part of the project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some. (It depends on how you organize your project)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the recent project, when plotting, does it still work when x axis is a list of string and y axis is a list of numbers? I always think that it has to be numbers for both axes..</p></li>
</ul>
<p>it should work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m still unsure on how to relate the frequencies of words to logarithmic functions, can we briefly go over this again in class on Tuesday?    Would it be more efficient to check if strings are equal to allowable strings, or if strings are equal to non-allowable strings? The reason I ask this is because in one of the books I used they used a different quotation mark symbol: “ ”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get rid of all the “unusual” characters, I would repleace everything that is not in the allowed characters. We can talk about the log again in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>so in regards to what we talked about on Thursday with the whole finding functions that model how the frequency for words in books decays….. what is the purpose? like I don’t really understand which direction to go with my analysis about it because it just seems a little bizarre…</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to see if there is nay difference/similaritis between different books</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the set doing in string processing?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>makes the characters unique, to avoid redundancy</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For this week of class, I had problem on the part 3, we need to save the file from the website write it into a file, then use the function to produce the graph?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. What is the question specifically? You need to read the book from the website and store it into a variable.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For Project 7, are there any more mathematical ways we could be analyzing our books besides looking at the graphs and trying to notice functions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You could also look at the most frequent words, and see if there are differences/similaties</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will there be 8 or 9 projects now that we’re nearing the end?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will be project 8 in the last week of classes</p>
<p>Can dictionaries be used to store more complex information, like a set of code?</p>
<p>I believe the values can be anything.</p>

<h2>Week 11<a class="headerlink" href="#week-11" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When you open a text file and write something in it and then close it and then reopen it to write something more in there, does it overwrite what was written? or does it start writing from the end?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on how you open the file. if you open it with “w” it will overwrite, if you oen with “a” it will start from the end of the file</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can the keys in a dictionary be different type? Like having both string and number as keys for the same dictionary. Can value also be different type.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you have a text file and the link to the text file is there a benefit to using one or the other in order to read the file? Is it better to work on a file directly or via a weblink?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>either methods are fine.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any type of ” f ‘ ” string formatting when writing a file using “f.write(…)” that will allow for a variable’s value to be written such as f.write( f’ The key used is {thekey} ‘). I know that code won’t really write the way I want it to as I’ve tried it, but I was wondering if there is any type of efficient string formatting when it comes to writing files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That method should work. I tryed it myself.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is NumPy a dictionary we just imported instead of made</p></li>
</ul>
<p>numpy is a module.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you find a corresponding key in a dictionary using a value?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mydict</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">{'george':</span> <span class="pre">16,</span> <span class="pre">'amber':</span> <span class="pre">19}</span></code>
<a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">``</span></a>print(list(mydict.keys())[list(mydict.values()).index(16)]) ``</p>
<p>will print george</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is it possible to drop one project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll talk more in details about this on Tuesday.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can we utilize the dictionary in the project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>for project 6you can check if the words in the message are in the dictionary. If there are a lot of matches then the message is very likely to be the correct one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any exploration needed for project 6 or is it just pretty standard?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no exploration, as written on the website.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are other methods of encryption? And which of those are most commonly used and why?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there are plenty. I think a quick google search might give you a handful of examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how to see if the text has been decrypted?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One way would be to check for commen words in the text.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For question 2 in sample quiz 11, why is d[4] = 9?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4 is the key and 9 is the corresponding value.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When should we use the append mode for text files?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>when you wwan tot add text to the file, without overwriting the existing content</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Not sure if I forgot but while creating a new text file, do we always do so in write mode? Is it possible to do the same even in read mode?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe you will need either “w” or “a”</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does the <cite>perm(s)</cite> function we used in Project 6 make use of dictionaries?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no. it uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enumerate</span></code> function</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the decryption project isn’t it possible to have more than 1 correct key?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no. I have encrypted your files one-by-one using a unique key.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the rest of the semester, will we learn more about Python libraries such as Numpy and Matplotlib or that is all we did for the class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we will look at other topics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you add multi-inline comments?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>#<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why is it important to close a file after opening it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>it reduces the risk of the file being unwarrantedly modified or read.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can a website forbid requests that we have covered in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>it might, if you do too many requests</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decryption project was fun. Will we be doing a project that will be dealing with decryption in the future?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<p>I found it was sort difficult while I was working on project 6 trying to exchange the columns to the new one.</p>
<p>this is not a question! Please ask a question next week, or it will not be counted.</p>

<h2>Week 10<a class="headerlink" href="#week-10" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Whats the point of trying to edit text files in python when it is more user friend ly to just do it in the text file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you might need to produce code that reads a file and automatically creates a text file. Imagine having to do 1000 files like that. automating the task would be very convenient.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how to set the plot animation to square? For example, when i try to make animation for a plot of [1,10] vs [1,100], the plot is like a rectangle, but I want it to be a square, how can I do that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>myabe <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.axis('equal')</span></code> ?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>do we need use file.close when we read some file. How do we change specific part of file. Like not some general worb. But like the first word on the fifth sentence or line?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes you always need to close the file. for the second question I found a useful link <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kite.com/python/answers/how-to-edit-a-file-in-python">here</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many projects do we have left for the semester? Also is it possible we can just make the rest of the projects due Sunday? It helps me work on it more and not rush.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3 or 4 left. yes I can move the deadline to Sunday</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are text files mainly used for? Does it have to do with HTML?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we will see a few applications. html could be a reasonable example</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does the function .tell() do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>tells you the position of the cursor in the file</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Once you have closed a txt file, how do you start writing without overwriting what you’ve already done?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you open in append mode using ‘a’</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When using the with open command to open a file, does it close after the function gets ran or it just doesn’t close at all?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you need to close it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>does the n character in a string count as one character?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. it is a special character.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are some ways to reduce the run time for a coding project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>avoid loops and redundancies. do as little if statements as possible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How will our work with text and strings relate to our upcoming projects (ciphers, encoded messages, etc.)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will need to open ad read a file, and then write the messagte in a new file.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we manipulated the string “Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me” and replaced ‘me’ with ‘you’, is there a way to replace only the last ‘me’ with ‘you’, while keeping the other ‘me’s in tact?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You could split the string on ‘me’ and then join it back up to the second to last element, then join using ‘you’.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m aware that this is a math and coding class. In terms of jobs/internships, where exactly would the lessons and concepts learnt here be applicable? Any info regarding this will be helpful in my future job searches. Thank you in advance!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You are learning how to apply pyhton coding to application problems. The goal of the class is to give you knowledge of python and code building skills that can be applied to any problem. In addition the class is helping you to develop the know-how to build a report.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I find out that the Python tools section in our class website is really helpful. Will we can still access to the class website after the semester ends ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please remind em at the end of the semester. I can give you the html files for those pages.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m curious to know if we can do this week’s project in 3d? and how to do it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The epidemic project? There is a 3d plot function, I believe it is called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plot3d</span></code>. However I don’t know if it would render as good as the 2d colormap we are using. It could be interesting to explore it!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does compressing the code help make it run faster, or is it just the way it works, are there other factors that help?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean by compressing? there is a question (above) similar to yours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we going to continue using arrays for future projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes, but not as extensively.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is Latex code usable when writing in text files?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not in .txt files.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can tuple be used in a function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes, but rememebr that they cannot be modified</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>when it comes to broadcasting for numpy arrays, how can two arrays of different shapes add onto one another if one of their dimensions is 1?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The array with dimensinon 1 will be repeated to match the other dimension.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How to joint the lines when reading a text file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>first use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">readlines</span></code> to read it, then join them.</p>
<p>To separate strings by character</p>
<p>If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code> is  a string, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list(s)</span></code>  will generate a list of each single character.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we have more projects related to what is going on in the world today?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not really.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I noticed there was a global variable in the animation function, can you better explain them and why we use them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is so the function animating the project can access it. Global variables are defined globally, so they do not need to be redifined inside the function.</p>

<h2>Week 9<a class="headerlink" href="#week-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do we iterate through an array in a for loop, why is it sometimes we get an error unless we make a copy?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>if the array comes form reaading an image, it is due to the image being protected to avoid being modified. If it is somethign else, I might need to look at the code.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When doing the function for epidemics, why wouldn’t we use the range(1,202) instead of (1,201)? Wouldn’t range (1,202) go from rows 1 to 201 which is what we want to cycle through? I don’t understand why it would be (1,201) because that doesn’t’t seem like enough.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The array is 202x202 with indeces going from 0 to 201. If you want to cover indeces 1-200 (to skip the first and last) you need range(1,201)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For part 1, is a graph of all the cells supposed to come out or is that just part 2? Also can we include part 4 in our part 1 or should it be separate?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can include part 4 in part 1 (just leave the vaccination probability to 0) Part 1 is the creation of the function. then you will get the results for part 2,3,4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is just selecting the green component of an image and displaying that with cmpa=’gray’ enough or do we need to memorize the formula for conversion?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>it is good enough</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How can slicing an array (of random entries) be used for the locations of the healthy/sick cells?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>the random array is used to decide if a cell will get sick/recover</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain array Broadcasting. I am a confused when you can add arrays of different dimention.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you start matching dimensions from the end of both arrays. If the dimension is the same or one of them is 1 you can combine the arrays</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For adding arrays, can you add arrays as long as one of the dimensions matches or is it only if both match and/or contain a 1?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>see answer above.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you only read in an image if it is in the same folder as the file you are working in?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not necessarily. You can give the path of the image, but it is easier to read it from the folder.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the Halloween exercise we were suppose to zero out the green, why did we need the relative concentration?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You need the realtive concentration since green contibutes also to other colors (yellow, cyan) and you don’t want to erase those.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How have arrays of different shapes sum together by both having a dimension of 1? What is the process? Is the sum always a ‘matrix’ or a vector?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pytho is going to replicate the array with a dimension of 1 to match the other dimension.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why do we start from the end when checking for matching in array broadcasting?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know. It might have to do with memory usage, but it is just a wild guess</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This question stems from curiosity. Will we be learning more about arrays/matrices in the coming weeks or about some other python related concept?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>other python topics</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>in the current project, how to decide if a cell is near the edge?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>based on its indeces. (index 0 is near the edge for example)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When should we be expecting our grades for projects 3 and 4?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Project 3 is out. project 4 I’ll do my best to return it by Wednesday  (end of the day). Sorry it is taking so long.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When displaying the grayscale color map for a specific image, which layer component is best to display using “plt.imshow”, the red, green or blue layer?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>green</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have the images built for the virus growth, but what do I need to do to produce an animation with them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you need to modify the code I gave you, and use your epidemic function in it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does broadcasting allow the use multiplication and division to combine arrays of different dimensions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can a person who already healed from the disease get vaccinated?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this project a healed person cannot get sick again, so it has the same effect of being vaccinated. So it would not be efficient to vaccinate healed people</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>in project 8 will i ever need a for loop or will numpy functions be sufficient enough to complete any process across an entire array?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>project 8?? Do you mean project 5? You can do the project without a loop on the array, but it is complicated. if you are interested in that approach we can discuss about it in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using the techniques we’ve learned up to this point to work on our upcoming projects (which will involve working with text)? Or will we be learning new facets of code that we haven’t seen yet in order to approach them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use some of what we have learned in the upcoming projects.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would we ever use math functions that are in python for project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we might.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For part three of the project, how do we define a variable which counts the probability of of infection</p></li>
</ul>
<p>pi, and you choose some values for the exploration</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do more broadcasting in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can. Just remind me on Tuesday.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>still feel hard on the project. is it a graph (computer science meaning) or other thng?</p></li>

<p>can you be more specific with your question?</p>
</section>
<section id="week-8">
<h2>Week 8<a class="headerlink" href="#week-8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you know when a True/False statement would print out of a function rather than values?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends what you ask to python. If you have an array <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a&gt;3</span></code> will be an array of booleans, whereas <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a[a&gt;3]</span></code> will show the values of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span></code> that are greater than 3.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you know how many other small (1 week long) projects we will have? Is there a specific number of short projects we will do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably 2 more</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How far can we actually go in terms of putting “for” loops in “for” loops, or is it just as much as our computer can handle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The least you put the better. If you put too many your computer might not enjoy that.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does changing the level of transparency visually change about an image? Aside from the red green and blue levels, a forth level called transparency. How does this forth level affect the image?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The transparency of the color. For example black with 50% transparency will look like gray. (Also it will be transparent, so it would be possible to see through it)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I dont know how to word it. Say I have 2400 by 1500 array (pixcel). Is there a way that we can make it 100 by 100 array. Like do we have to go through a list to do it? Can we use some sort array.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you can use the function reshape. But it might be tricky to get exactly what you want. It might be easier to make a list of arrays, and then use the reshape function.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The function .shape returns the shape of an array.  Does that mean when .shape is used on an image that the shape returned is the height and width of the image? For example if the shape returned is (1500,1200,3) would the width of the image be 1200 and the height be 1500?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>width would be 1500 pixels and height 1200 pixels.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the question on mean of the char picture is still not quiet clear</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean? the mean of a character reperesents how dark/light the character is on average.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we going to have more exercises in class to show participation?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you made a subplot like <cite>plt.subplot(1,2,3)</cite>, what would 1, 2, and 3 each represent?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1: number of rows
2: number of columns
3: position</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you print a column in a nested list like list[1][1] prints something from the second column but slicing like  list[:4][1] does not work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot slice lists like you did in the second way. You might want to use list comprehension to build the list with the pieces you need and then display it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>when characterizing an image, do the dimensions have to be divisible by 24 and 15?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no. You can drop the extra pixels that you would get.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you sort a list containing strings alphabetically in the same way you would sort list with numbers in sequential order?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I am trying to write a function to plt.imshow() many pictures and combine with subplot. However, it does not work as my expectation. Instead of 2 rows and  3 columns, it is 6 rows and 1 columns. Can we do this in class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you are probably doing plt.show() after each plot. You should use plt.show() at the end only. We can do something in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Earlier, when you did an example where a = np.random.rand(4,4,3) and tried plt.imshow(a[:,:,0]), why did it not plot the red scale?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because when you imshow() a two-dimensional array it does not have RGB channels, but only one channel. So python will use a colormap to represent it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What’s the difference between a tuple and an array?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A tuple is like a list (but it cannot be modified after creation). An array allows for vectorial opeartions and its faster to compute on.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we convert an image to consist of white and black only?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes if you plot it with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gray</span></code> colormap</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there an easier way to do this week’s project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there might be.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are some major applications of arrays besides computer images?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Applied math problems can be solved with arrays.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does the arrays of the RGB have the same shape as those of the pixels in the same corresponding positions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m confusing in converting 3 layers in to 1 layers. So we know that a graph can be converting into grayscale by 0.3R+0.59G+0.11B, but when I try to use this formula to convert a graph, it did be converted into one layer, but when I call plt.imshow(), the graph is still colored. and it turns to gray only when i call plt.imshow(graph,cmap=’gray’).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because when you imshow() a two-dimensional array it does not have RGB channels, but only one channel. So python will use a colormap to represent it.</p>
<p>If we can read an image and assign a variable, can we program an image matching program by comparing the values?</p>
<p>I think so</p>
<p>Had trouble with slicing the gray scaled image into pieces and try to use that to form the image with characters.</p>
<p>Not a question.</p>
<p>You said we’ll be using this project for another project, can we use our same code?</p>
<p>We will use similar ideas. But not the same code.</p>

<section id="week-7">
<h2>Week 7<a class="headerlink" href="#week-7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you have to re run everything cell of code if you imported something at the top? Sometimes it says np not defined so I re run it, then it works, but other times I do not have to re run things. Is there a reason why?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I believe it depends where you are using the new import you made.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to make plotting shorter/faster? Every time I plot something for a project I copy and paste almost all of the commands for the title, axis, and x and y limits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create a function that plots, and use string formatting to automate the title, axis,….</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do you zero out things that aren’t multiples of 7?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>myarray[~ (myarray%7==0)] =0` should work</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will boolean arrays be useful to use beyond their application in Project 3? And if yes, will our future projects involve much more complicated boolean statements compared to what we used in the project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes (for project 4 and 5), they might be more simple statements or more complicated depending on how you approach the problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you explain how to use subplot when the plots are function. Like say if I have function ‘a’ and ‘b’ that when I call them graph a plot. but how do I so a sub plot with them. I say that with subplot you have to give them the point to subplot. So What I am saying is can you make a subplot with function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can make subplots with functions. For example you could make a function takes the parameter for a subplot like number of rows, cols and position. Then you can have the function plot the subplot. As long as you do not run plt.show() you can keep on using the function to plot on the same plot using subplot.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are the patterns in the graphs outputted in part 3 of the Newton’s Method project a known pattern, or was it unintentional that we were to discover that they look like this?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are called fractals.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is a reshaped array the same thing as a matrix? Also where the baby pictures at?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on the dimensions. An array with 2 dimensions is a matrix. An arrya can however have more than two dimensions. Baby pictures?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the bonus section on Project 3 an “all or nothing” reward, or can you be eligible for partial bonus credit too?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I would say it’s all or nothing, but you might get the bonus even if you did not completely finish the bonus part.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we read the image in python is there a limit size required or no limit?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Technically there is not limit.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a numerical grade for the projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A=97%, A- = 92%, B+ = 88.5% ,….</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is a mesh? What separates it from an arrray?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A mesh is a reticulate (or grid) or points. It is very convenient to use array to store meshes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When using mathematical operations on two multidimensional arrays, do the arrays have to have the same dimensions or can they be different?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are sime rules that allows to do operations with arrays of different sizes, but we haven’t seen them yet. (It is called broadcasting)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are the things we can do with numpy?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Very efficient vectorial operations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>in this week we mainly focus on building projects. But I met some problem in adjusting x and y axis for plot. Specifically, I’m trying to plot a series of number, and some of them have a very high y value, which will make the y axis become wide. but I only want to focus on a small range of y, I want to ignore the points that is not in this range. Normally I can use ylim to set the range, but it somehow did not work for me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We should look at this more in details (maybe during office hours)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the biggest advantage to using a list over a numpy array just the fact that data of different types can go into a list but not an array?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also you can change the size of a list, while you cannot with arrays.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we going be working with complex numbers in future projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>can print() command be used to output latex code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I am not sure. But I do not think so.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what is difference between help() and dir()?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>help() gives information on a function. dir() list all of the functions/variables in a module</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The core of MTH 337 is research, which is implemented with the help of coding in Jupyter Notebook. So, what are some tips you would give for people, new into research? I also feel it would be helpful for doing well in projects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When describing the results, you shoudl always try to explain why the results is important/significant and give an idea of why the result is happening. Also explore any direction that you might think it is interesting.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the new material, I do not have any questions. For the project we have did, I had a hard time to form the graphs are given code and how to produce the graphs by using my newton function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We shoud have discussed this either in class or during office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In order to perform better in the project, should we read more outside resources?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it could help for the introduction or to find additional direction for the exploration. But it is not necessary. I try to give as many information as I can during class, and during office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are applications of linspaces and arrays besides images?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of applied math applications (like approximation of derivatives, and solving problems with differential equations) start from linspaces, and use arrays heavily</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be working with mutable and immutable objects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not specifically. We use them in projects, and you shoudl always keep in mind that when working with mutable types you have to make a copy when you do not want to mofify the original variable</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using images for our next project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Could it have been possible to extend Newton’s method to approximating roots of functions beyond the format, f(z) = z^n - 1 and would we achieve a similar fractal pattern from these graphs?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It could be possible to extend it. I do not know if we woud get a fractal for each polynomial.</p>

</ul>
<p>If the markdown contains formulas you shoudl definitely use LaTeX</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Next week, will we get more time in class to talk about graphing the newton function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we will</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For Part 1 of Project 3, do we only need to plot the final approximation value after 100 (or 200) iterations of the <cite>newton</cite> function, or do we need a graph that plots all 100 (or 200) approximation values for each x in the linspace like in the plot displayed on the course website?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The plot on the website showns the value of the 100th iteration of newton for all the points you start with.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Once we have the newton function printing a list of roots for the project, what should our next step be?</p></li>

<p>This is not a question. You should come to office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the matrix that we lean how do we change value. Like say A is a matrix and A[0,0]=3 and I do like it to change 4. How do I do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A[0,0]=4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project, in the part where we need a desired tolerance to find a root, will we be given that tolerance or is that something that will be different for each case or is it something we need to find?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you can pick 0.001 or even 0.01 as your tolerance</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’ve gotten the graph to display the roots, but I’m still unsure how to make it look like it does on the project description.  Are we going to be doing any projects based on real world applications?</p></li>

<p>We can talk about the graph on Tuesday (or at office hours). Yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does np.arange do? I missed the class where you first talked about it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The same as range. But it creates a numpy array and you can use a step that is not integer</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.arange(1,2,6,0.5)</span></code> will create the array <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[1</span> <span class="pre">1.5</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">2.5]</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a way to assign a variable? All of our functions revolved around giving an output as a number (at least for this project), but how can we extend this.

</ul>
<p>The question is not clear. We can talk about it in class on Tuesday.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In this week we studied how to build the project using numpy library, but I met a problem when I try to plot out the data. In short, I would like to only show the data that is inside a given range, [0,10] for example, usually I can achieve this through xlim and ylim, however, they didn’t work at all, and I don’t know why this issue happened.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this is not a question.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does passing a function into a function work like we did for the project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You pass the function as an argument (say <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code>) of another function (say <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">g</span></code>), and then you can use the function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code> inside the function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">g</span></code> calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code> with the correct arguments.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what does the np.meshgrid command do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>repeats the two vectors given as arguments one over rows and one over columns.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is project 3 due this Friday?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we use the tolerance (For project 3), to determine the convergence?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we write a function to do the derivative or we could import it from a library?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can write it ourself.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What if for a project, after plotting, we observe some pattern(or sth special), we state that out but have no idea to explain why it happens? Will we got a reduction in grade for that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You shoudl always try to justify/explain your findings.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>can we manipulate arrays in the same way as lists?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes and no. You shoudl look at my notes from last week, and stop by office hours.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do calculation on np.empty?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I did not understand how to start for step 2 in the project. Especially the part that I have to show the complex plane</p></li>
</ul>
<p>First you generate the plane using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">meshgrid</span></code> than you can apply newton to the plane and check what root you end up close to.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we transpose a row to column and vice versa in matrices? What is the difference between multidimensional array and a matrices?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes we can. 2 dimensional arrays are basically like matrices. However there are arrays with more than 2 dimensions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we use eigen vectors or values for future projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No.</p>

<section id="week-5">
<h2>Week 5<a class="headerlink" href="#week-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we talk about errors in code in class more? Like when getting a certain error, how to figure out what it means and where to go from there? Or maybe just attach on the website a good link as a resource.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can see a few examples, but overall it’s going to get better the more you use python.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When you create an empty array, how do you fill the array with entries?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you use the indeces. ( I will show an example in class)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I know you compared arrays to vectors, but can arrays have multiple rows? or is that something with a different type?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes they can. They are called multidimensional arrays</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why do we sometimes only import a few things from math rather than just import the whole thing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That way I don’t need the math prefix.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>can you turn an array to a list? if you can how do you go from an array to a list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">list(myarray)</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would np arrays be similar to arrays in other programming languages like c? What are the advantages of the list or arrays?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. They are faster for computations, and allow vectorial operations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what is the relationship between the p and the amount of circles? Do I actually need to compute their total area?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between p and the amount of circles is for you to explore in the project. You do not have to compute the total ara of the colored circles.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What exactly is the time() function used for?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It tells you how many seconds have passed from Jan. 1 1970</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difference between arrays and lists?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several that are listed on my notes. A big difference is that arrays must contain elements of the same tyoe and cannot be resized.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why do we need a a large number of points to plot a circle?(using the cos and sin functions)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To get a smooth line.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What would you recommend studying outside of class to better prepare for the third project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will see everything we need in class. We will work with Newton’s method and complex numbers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can Numpy be used in the loops?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, but you should not do it unless there is no other way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are all the things matplotlib lets us do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot. You should ask this to google. :)</p>
<p>-I’m sorry if this was answered in class, but can we iterate through an array? Or is the whole point of an array so that we don’t have to iterate through it?</p>
<p>Yes, but you should not do it unless there is no other way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When we create array with numpy. For example: np.ones(3), the output will be: array([1. , 1. , 1.]) Is every element in the array type “float” or “int” because I see the “.” after 1? What is the reason behind that?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a float by default, but it can be changed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In what circumstances would the np.empty() command be useful if the array is filled with random values?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have to create a big array for storing numbers later, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.empty</span></code> is very efficient</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Now that we’ve learned about arrays, which are similar to lists, will there always be a need for one or the other? Or will we start to use one more than the other?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the application one might be better than the other.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>def myfun(x,y): for k in range(0,n): if (something is true) == false:     return False return True Is that work?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. I think I use a similar structure for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isdisjoint</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the second project, still having problem processing the isdisjoint part and the graph for it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not a question.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you store data of different types in arrays like with lists?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>While working on the project, I was trying to plot 10000 circles and nothing ever showed up after I waited for like 10 minutes. Is there a better way to plot a large number of circles?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there might be a better way, but I don’t think plotting is the issue. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gen_centers</span></code> function is probably taking long to generate the centers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using more circle graphs or have any similar projects like project 2?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use graphing in a lot of projects.</p>
</section>
<section id="week-4">
<h2>Week 4<a class="headerlink" href="#week-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is the project still going to be due next week Friday?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When would it be more beneficial to return a tuple as opposed to a list? If a list can be changed, wouldn’t it be better to return a list most of the time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on the application. (I answered a similar question in the past weeks)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the references section of our projects, are URLs sufficient or do we have to cite the websites in a specific way?  Why is it necessary to add 1 when using the Zeta function in Python?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the references the URL is enough, and you should also mark where you use it in the text. We need to add one, because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zetac</span></code> skips the first term.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One question is for next week quiz do we have to memorize all the color in making graph and all the different shape (like triangle, squre). For the project is it batter it have more math idea then have using code to test them. What happen is out mathematics idea is wrong but have suffeciant coding demonestration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the quiz I would try to remember the main colors and symbols (s,o,*,^). For the project the math and python are strictly connected. If you get the math wrong the code would not work properly.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the code from Thursday when assigning colors to circles we used the line, colors=[cm.cool((r**-1)%1) for r in rlist], can you explain why we use (r**-1)%1 ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How do you get a colormap to show more of the range of colors? Like how when we did cm.cool it was mostly only blue, not much of the rest of the range.</p>
<p>A color map can be assigned any value in the (0,1) range. The way we did it was to take the reminder of the integer division and use it as the input. Very likley all of the numbers we picked gave a similar reminder.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Since we can do calculations in the list, can we also loop in the list?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you mean excatly? You can use a list in a for loop, and you can use a loop when doing list comprehension.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m curious if there is a trick to plotting. for example looking at the plots from this week, it has a lot of code for one graph and it seams like a lot of components that can be easily messed up. Is it just a trial and error thing? should we just keep playing with the graphs until it look’s its best?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The short answer is yes. The plotting is a part of what it is usually referred to as ‘post processing’. It will take a little bit of time to get the hang of it, but the more you plot, the more used to it you will become; and it will feel a little less trial and error.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do shape other than circles in the exploration part of this project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, but checking for disjointness and avoid overlapping is more complex.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Find the connect of Geometric series and p-series with the original circle graph.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the question? The area of the big circle is the sum of the series, the areas of the small circles are the individual terms of the series.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>More for projects and going forward, but when is it okay to just leave a comment in the code cell, and what requires a markdown cell explaining the code? Or should I just default to going in depth through markdown, and using a simplified explanation in the code comments?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should just default to going in depth through markdown, and using a simplified explanation in the code comments?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How do separate the values returned from a function if more than one is returned? Do you have to set two variables  equal to the return or can you pick one out?.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you can do both. I’ll show an example in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How was your weekend?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fine, but that is not relevant to the class. Questions like this will not be accepted.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the project, will we have to show both series on separate plots, or on the same plot?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each series in a separate plot</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you just list the steps for the Project 2 ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. (We have been doing this already for the whole week)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does the function zetac() do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Computes the sum of a cnovergent p-series, skipping the first term.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is it possible to record the course and upload to somewhere? jupyter script is really useful but there are some quick questions that we asked during the course not being include in the srcipt, and I really would like to review them when I’m doing the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t plan on recording the class, but I mentioned in the first lecture that you will need a notebook to take notes during class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One question I would have is will we continue graphing in future projects or only for a select few?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Already asked last week. Please check weekly summary 3</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do you have any advice on how to analyze the information from the project document? For example, how can you know which helper function we should create after reading the project handout?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on what structure you want to give to the project. I will try to guide you when possible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>i’m xonfusing about so called analize part in the project. can you talk about it on class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What exactly do the “In[ ]” and “Out[ ]” in the Jupyter notebook mean? Say for instance, we have Out[20] , does it mean it’s the 20th entry in a list called Out?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Input and output. Out[20] is the 20th output.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will certain weeks of class focus more on building the coding skills necessary to complete that week’s project? And will other weeks focus more on general Python skills?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main idea is to explain python topics that we will use in the projects.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does the random module work? How does it determine if the number it chooses is indeed random?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>there is an algorithm that generate pseudo-random numbers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>can a list containing lists also contain units not within a list?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>not clear. A list can contain any type of variable.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using any more math equations in the future and show graphs for them?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes. in project 3 for example.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there a way to or not to manually input circles on the main circle.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>to manually inout circles you can use the <cite>add_patch</cite> command.</p>

<h2>Week 3<a class="headerlink" href="#week-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do a project related to cryptography?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we will do something relative to encryption</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will there be set times during class where we can ask questions about the projects each week?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can always ask questions about the projects (at anytime during class).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When creating an initial list and setting a new variable to the list both list change if one is updated, is this because the when a list is set to another variable the variable takes the address of the where the list is stored instead of making another list?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be using any other programs throughout the course? And is every project going to have some type of graph (use plotly)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think we will be using any external program. Most of the projects will have graphs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I know I asked this in class, but how would I plot the numeric values of a nested list? Like if I have a list [ [a,b,c], [d,e,f] ], where a,b,c,d,e,f are numeric values, how do I plot [a,b,c] as a line, and then [d,e,f] as another line?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mylist[0]</span></code> -&gt; [a,b,c]</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mylist[1]</span></code> -&gt; [d,e,f]</p>
<p>One question I have is all the color we can use i n graph. Like black(k) blue(b)  and yellow(y) what other color are there. Also I only know about doted line and continuas line. Can you tell what other kind of graph are there.</p>
<p>magenta (m), red (r), green (g). There are several linestyles and symbols. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_markers.asp">Here</a> is more information</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When using matplotlib, is there a way to plot points on a graph and connect those points with a line while still visibly seeing each point “marker”/dot on the graph?   For example, when we graphed the squares of numbers with markers, how could you connect those points with a line while still seeing each point?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.plot(x,y,'gs;)</span></code> will plot a green line (g) ans squares (s) for each point</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To get spell check for Python, where do you input the commands from the blog? Do you open the jupyter notebook terminal?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That should work</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many hours a week should we be spending outside of class working on our projects and/or studying?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s really hard to quantify. But you should spend enpough time to get familiar with the new code commands that we learn each week. On top of that you should spend some time working on the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difference between the insert command and the append command for lists</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">append</span></code> adds an element at the end of the list. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">insert</span></code> allows you to chose the position (index) of where the new element will go.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Concerned with the project, is there any recommended number of plots to use?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends on the resutls that you want to show. There isn’t a right or wrong number. I would use at least a couple of plots two present two resutls.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we use a source for the project I know we should cite it, but should we just use parenthetical citations and link the website, cite it at the bottom of the project under sources, or both? Also should it be cited in a particular way such as APA or MLA etc.?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you reference some text (citation) You should put the citation in-between quotation marks “” and you should write next to the citation the origin of it (book, website,…). At the end of the project you can also report sources that you used for you research</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m confused as to what use the tuple has. Why do we need a set that can’t be changed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There might be cases in which you want a variable, whose elements cannot be changed. For example you have a list of numbers that has to stay fixed. It can be convenient to use a tuple, so taht you won’t be able to change it.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we ever have a project/talk about a project that requires more than one file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will be projects in which we will upload files into the notebook (like a text file or an image)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Would you take points of from code if the code is too much but accomplishes the task assigned (i.e. the code could have been done obviously better)?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends how much overcomplicated the code is.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why does Python require a distinction between mutable and non-mutable variables?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is both a memory ‘issue’ and a coding ‘issue’. Sometimes you might need a varaible that should not be changed after creation, in that case you would use a non-mutable object.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there a minimum page number required for the project?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>no.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Plot the graph while doing the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>this is not a question.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is figsize(10,8) always a standard size when we plot or we can adjust to produce the best look for our notebook?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can pick the size.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When is it recommended to write code in a list comprehension format versus writing it all out?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I usually use list comprehension when possible to make the code more compact. I believe part of it is also based on ersonal preference.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are we gonna get our first project’s grades back before the next one’s due? (so we know where to work and improve on)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>for the project, I design the code to return a special sequence, but should I analyze the outputs? because it seems too simple if I only introduce the code itself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have talked about this a lot in class. You should have a look at the reposrt guide section of the class website.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>im wondering what will we learn next</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will keep working with lists for a little and then we will move to arrays.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the difference between a tuple and a list?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>the tuple cannot be chamnged after creation, while the list can</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>is there a sheet that has all of the edit commands for the graphs?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>google matplolib.pyplot. Also <a class="reference external" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_markers.asp">here</a> is more information</p>
<p>Are the weekly summaries always due on Sundays now?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A question I had was how to use some defined functions inside of a new function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Say that you have the function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is_even(n)</span></code> that return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> if a number is even</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_even</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you have a function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">even_avg(k)</span></code> computing the average of all even numbers from 0 to k (included) you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is_even</span></code> as follows</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">even_avg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>That is very hard to quantify. We will try to spend some time working in class, but you are aexpected to work on your own to complete the project</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>is there any rules in project 1’s sequence? it seems like when the input numbers is big enough, the return sequence always looks the same for the first a few numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This could be an interesting direction to explore in the project</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I noticed in some functions that we wrote in class, there weren’t any arguments and in others there were arguments. Can you explain why some functions have arguments and some don’t and how to know when to use arguments and when not to?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>it depends on what does the function needs. Most of the functions we will define will have arguments.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many projects are we looking at over the course of the semester?</p></li>
<li><p>How much projects will we have over the whole course?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>a minimum of 7, a maximum of 10 depending on how quickly we get through the material</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does the project only require two functions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It requires the two basic functions mentioned in the project description. Then you might define others if you think it could be useful.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there any method to obtain the largest numeric value in a list? I’m not talking about the largest index, I mean the largest numeric entry into the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><cite>max()</cite></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what’s the difference between a while loop and a for loop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are both used when there is a task that has to be repeated. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loop is usually preferred when we have a known range to work on, whereas the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">while</span></code> loop is used when there is a condition to be verified to countinue the loop.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the proect are we writing all the text in the jupyter notebook as markdown or are we making a pdf like you showed us and sending 2 file (pdf and code). One there question, can you explain the “continue” one more time. We also learned about, and or, and not, can you explain “not” again.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the project you have to write the text in markdown and submit one single ipynb document. (The same question was asked last week, please read the answers to the weekly summary). I will do one more example with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">continue</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">not</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When should I use a while loop, and when should I use break? I may be mistaken, but they seem to serve the same purpose. If so, is one better than the other?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you build the while loop correctly, you might not need a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code>. But you might need a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> to make the code more “simple”. I’ll show an example in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many parts should our project have?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It dependes on your style. The project should have and introduction,body, and conclusion sections. The body section can be divided in parts depending on the structure you want to give to the project.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How complex will the functions we define in this course get? Will we get to a point where we are writing functions inside of functions?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>we might.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I encounter a problem that a cell contains[*] after executed and you explained that I have an infinite loop. Can you explain it in detail and how can we avoid it while using the <cite>for</cite> loop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You should not encounter an infinite loop while using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loop. Do you mind sending me the code so I can look at it?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The term “exclusive or” was mentioned in class on Thursday. Could you describe what that term means and when it could be used in code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>exclusive or means an expression is True if one of them is True, but it is False if either are True or False. It can be don in python by doing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bool1</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">bool2</span></code></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>what exactly the peoject wants us to do? still don’t know what’s ‘Write a Python function full_sequence(k) that for each positive integer k returns its corresponding sequence’. is it saying that i output the only sequence if the number is in it and output nothing if the number is not in it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The project asks to explore the sequence described in the project page. The function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">full_sequence</span></code> that we will look at in class, should produce the sequence corresponding to the input number given, as explanined in the project page.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the fastest way to end an infinite loop once it starts?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In jupyter push on the stop button in the menu. In general, you will need to kill the execution of the program.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In your project guidelines you state our code should be well organized and well commented. Do you have any specifics for the comment format or are particular about the white space in the code? Simplified - are we allowed to organize and format our code in any way we wish as long as it is generally well organized, in order, and well explained?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we do some background research about our projects?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>sure. Just don’t cop and paste text from the internet.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the different between integer and float?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>integers are integer numbers, float are decimal numbers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>while loop seems like the only part that I have a lit problem on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a question. I will do one more example with while loop today in class.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we see more examples of how to do the write up for our projects? You said that usually students fail the first project and they don’t know what to expect but I am aiming for something higher than an F.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are good examples of a project report online on the class website.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>can a <cite>while</cite> loop and <cite>if</cite> be used in one code. Is using range one way to do the project</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The question is not clear. The project can be done in different way depending on the structure you want to give to your code.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How many times can you use Break in the code? Can you use Break to stop a single command in the code without stopping the entire code?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">break</span></code> wil stop a loop, not a single command.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I don’t know why you use f when your write a string.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
n = 20
divisors = []</p>
<dl>
<dt>for d in range(1,n): # range of possible divisers</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>if n/d== 1:</dt><dd><p>divisors.append(d)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>print(f’the divisors of {n} are {divisors}’)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">``</span></a>f` is used to format the string. this way python is going to evaluate what is between the curly brackets, and it will print the value of the given expression.</p>

<section id="week-1">
<h2>Week 1<a class="headerlink" href="#week-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How mathematical are we going to get in this class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some topics/projects will be more mathematical than others. I will always introduce/refresh the topics necessary for each project</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we start the Tuesday quizzes next week? Where will the notes be posted?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. the notes are posted in the class website under the <a class="reference internal" href="weekly_schedule.html"><span class="doc">Weekly Schedule</span></a> tab</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How hard does the coding in jupyter notebook get? So far it seems quite straightforward but there is already a bit of memorization to it. Was wondering if it gets much more difficult in terms of the coding aspect, or if we learn tools to tackle more in depth questions, and the difficulty comes more from the math itself rather the coding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So far we have starting from the coding basis. As we proceed with the class the coding will become more convoluted, and will require a little more ingenuity. We will use this conviluted code to build the tools to tackle the questions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(What/How many) other modules (besides math and numpy) will we learn to draw from over the course of the semester?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few more. The plotting one for example, but also a module for internet ‘searches’ and for pattern investigation for example. We might see some more…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>how can i format integer or string values into LaTeX?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>LaTeX goes in Markdown cells while the values of variable are in code cells. I would use a markdown cell with the LaTeX and then I would add a code cell printing the varaible output</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does adding an item to a list keep its type? For example if you make a list with an integer and a string do they remain as an integer and string in the list or is there type changed to on uniform type?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A list can contain elements of different types, and the element type is not changed when they are added to the list.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>i’m feeling diffcult on proform the formulas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a question.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Going forward, are the quizzes mostly going to be asking about syntax of code and writing Python code on paper?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, and also given some code, write what would the corresponding outout be.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Why does jupyter notebook require an f in every print statement but python doesn’t?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That is called string formatting. Not all print instructions require the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f</span></code> in front of it. Also string formatting is not just for Jupyter notebook, but it can used in “regualr” python</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I’m a bit confused on the difference between LaTeX and markdown. Could you explain more about which one you should use for different situations? Is LateX just the format you use to write equations and should that always be done in markdown?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>LaTeX is a specific type of formatting to render math formulas nicely. LaTex is used in markdown cells. Markdown cells ususally contain text.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Will we be learning how to plot in this class?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, in week 2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How does Kernel work? You said to ‘Restart and Run’ all projects before turning them in which I haven’t tried but the word “restart” makes me feel like my code will get deleted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code is saved on you computer. Think of the code as a recipe for a cake. When you run your code in jupyter notebook, you follow the code instructions (recipe) and get some outputs (cake). Restarting the kernel and re-running the code will run the code again producing new output (a brand new cake) but will not erase the code saved on your computer (recipe)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does the material covered in this course relate python specifically to math-related applications? Or are we diving deeper into the uses of Python, but math-related code is just helpful to know?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We are exploring different applications. some are math related, some are not.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>1)About the Boolean expression, will the result that python execute will be as same as the truth table?  2)About the import module, e=100 from math import e y= sin(e) In this situation, will the variable e is calculated or the Euler’s number? 3) LateX $left(frac{1}{2},frac{1}{3}right)$ $left{frac{1}{2},frac{1}{3}right}$ $left[frac{1}{2},frac{1}{3}right]$  In this situation, for the parentheses and square bracket, it works when I type left( or right) But for the curly bracket {, it only works when I type left{ and error when I type left{.  Can you explain that please?  Thank you</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Not necessarily. A boolean expression is either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">False</span></code>. Python will execute the code if the boolean expression checked is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">True</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Yes, e=100  will be overwritten by the Euler number.</p></li>
<li><p>That is because LaTex uses the regular <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{</span></code> as a delimiter, so the correct way to indicate the curly bracket is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\{</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Are there ever cases where we need to specify the amount of decimal places that are needed in the output of our interest? i.e (print(f’.05:100f’))</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not necessarily in this class, but it is a good thing to remember how to do.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the quiz do we have to know everything from this week? One other thing is code are vary picky about  speling and formaing mistake (like forgeting : when writing code or “.” insted of “,”). will you also take off point in quiz for spelling and small formating mistake?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, and Yes. Coding requires precision, as the similar expression might do profoundly different things.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is there somewhere where I can see what all of the math commands (math.sin, math.pi, etc) do individually? I know that I can use help(math.whatever) but I don’t want to have to do that for each of the many commands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you can get a list of avaialble commands using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dir(math)</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">help</span></code> is sued with a specific function or command</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can we get Half- credit if half of the code is right?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>you will get partial credit in the projects.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If we write a code snippet like this: print(f”{1.1:5f}”), what does 5f mean? I’m aware using 0.5f gives 5 decimal places. Would 5f be an error?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It will fix the width of the number. (I can show an example in class)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is matplotlib and numpy a part of Jupyter Notebook/python, or are they completely separate  programs that we will need to get?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are included in anaconda. So you already have them</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How to write Latex functions in the markdown mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$</span></code> as delimiters, and then you need the correct LaTeX synthax.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the purpose of string formatting?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It helps authomating some output and avoids code repetion</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I have a question about the reports - Are they done fully in Jupyter? Including all the text? (We don’t have to write a separate report document?)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in Jupyter. You will use Markdon cells for text and Code cells for code.</p>
