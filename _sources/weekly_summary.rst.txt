Answers to Weekly Summary questions
===================================

Week 1
~~~~~~

* How mathematical are we going to get in this class?

Some topics/projects will be more mathematical than others. I will always introduce/refresh the topics necessary for each project

* Will we start the Tuesday quizzes next week? Where will the notes be posted?

Yes. the notes are posted in the class website under the :doc:`Weekly Schedule  <weekly_schedule>` tab

* How hard does the coding in jupyter notebook get? So far it seems quite straightforward but there is already a bit of memorization to it. Was wondering if it gets much more difficult in terms of the coding aspect, or if we learn tools to tackle more in depth questions, and the difficulty comes more from the math itself rather the coding.

So far we have starting from the coding basis. As we proceed with the class the coding will become more convoluted, and will require a little more ingenuity. We will use this conviluted code to build the tools to tackle the questions.

* (What/How many) other modules (besides math and numpy) will we learn to draw from over the course of the semester? 

A few more. The plotting one for example, but also a module for internet 'searches' and for pattern investigation for example. We might see some more...

* how can i format integer or string values into LaTeX?

LaTeX goes in Markdown cells while the values of variable are in code cells. I would use a markdown cell with the LaTeX and then I would add a code cell printing the varaible output

* Does adding an item to a list keep its type? For example if you make a list with an integer and a string do they remain as an integer and string in the list or is there type changed to on uniform type?

A list can contain elements of different types, and the element type is not changed when they are added to the list.

* i'm feeling diffcult on proform the formulas.

This is not a question. 

* Going forward, are the quizzes mostly going to be asking about syntax of code and writing Python code on paper?

Yes, and also given some code, write what would the corresponding outout be.

* Why does jupyter notebook require an f in every print statement but python doesn't?

That is called string formatting. Not all print instructions require the ``f`` in front of it. Also string formatting is not just for Jupyter notebook, but it can used in "regualr" python

* I'm a bit confused on the difference between LaTeX and markdown. Could you explain more about which one you should use for different situations? Is LateX just the format you use to write equations and should that always be done in markdown?

LaTeX is a specific type of formatting to render math formulas nicely. LaTex is used in markdown cells. Markdown cells ususally contain text.

* Will we be learning how to plot in this class?

Yes, in week 2

* How does Kernel work? You said to 'Restart and Run' all projects before turning them in which I haven't tried but the word "restart" makes me feel like my code will get deleted.

The code is saved on you computer. Think of the code as a recipe for a cake. When you run your code in jupyter notebook, you follow the code instructions (recipe) and get some outputs (cake). Restarting the kernel and re-running the code will run the code again producing new output (a brand new cake) but will not erase the code saved on your computer (recipe)

* Does the material covered in this course relate python specifically to math-related applications? Or are we diving deeper into the uses of Python, but math-related code is just helpful to know?

We are exploring different applications. some are math related, some are not.

* 1)About the Boolean expression, will the result that python execute will be as same as the truth table?  2)About the import module, e=100 from math import e y= sin(e) In this situation, will the variable e is calculated or the Euler's number? 3) LateX $\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3}\right)$ $\left\{\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3}\right\}$ $\left[\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3}\right]$  In this situation, for the parentheses and square bracket, it works when I type \left( or \right) But for the curly bracket {, it only works when I type \left\{ and error when I type \left{.  Can you explain that please?  Thank you 

1) Not necessarily. A boolean expression is either ``True`` or ``False``. Python will execute the code if the boolean expression checked is ``True``

2) Yes, e=100  will be overwritten by the Euler number.

3) That is because LaTex uses the regular ``{`` as a delimiter, so the correct way to indicate the curly bracket is ``\{``

* Are there ever cases where we need to specify the amount of decimal places that are needed in the output of our interest? i.e (print(f'.05:100f'))

Not necessarily in this class, but it is a good thing to remember how to do.

* For the quiz do we have to know everything from this week? One other thing is code are vary picky about  speling and formaing mistake (like forgeting : when writing code or "." insted of ","). will you also take off point in quiz for spelling and small formating mistake? 

Yes, and Yes. Coding requires precision, as the similar expression might do profoundly different things.

* Is there somewhere where I can see what all of the math commands (math.sin, math.pi, etc) do individually? I know that I can use help(math.whatever) but I don't want to have to do that for each of the many commands.

you can get a list of avaialble commands using ``dir(math)``. ``help`` is sued with a specific function or command

* Can we get Half- credit if half of the code is right?

you will get partial credit in the projects.

* If we write a code snippet like this: print(f"{1.1:5f}"), what does 5f mean? I'm aware using 0.5f gives 5 decimal places. Would 5f be an error?

It will fix the width of the number. (I can show an example in class)

* Is matplotlib and numpy a part of Jupyter Notebook/python, or are they completely separate  programs that we will need to get?

They are included in anaconda. So you already have them

* How to write Latex functions in the markdown mode.

``$`` as delimiters, and then you need the correct LaTeX synthax.

* What is the purpose of string formatting?

It helps authomating some output and avoids code repetion

* I have a question about the reports - Are they done fully in Jupyter? Including all the text? (We don't have to write a separate report document?)

All in Jupyter. You will use Markdon cells for text and Code cells for code.
