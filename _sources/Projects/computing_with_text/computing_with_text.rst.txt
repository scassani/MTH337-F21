Project
~~~~~~~

**Part 1.** For each of these texts perform the following tasks:

* Create a list of several (20 or so) words most frequently appearing in the text.

* Plot the count of all words appearing in the text against their ranks in
  the frequency order.

**Part 2.** Analyze differences and similarities between lists of most frequent words
and plots of words counts for all of these texts. Describe any patterns you see.


**Part 3** Choose one (or more) book(s) on `Project Gutenberg <http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ website, and repeat the steps for part 1 and 2. (Use ``requests`` to access the additional books). Compare your result with the other books and describe any patterns you see.
